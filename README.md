- The project was a part of the Software Process Course.
- Developed an Android application using the Waterfall model which helped the international students 
who face challenges before or after coming to the university, for example, accommodation. It was kind of a discussion forum. The students could view the email ids and the majors registered, so that they can contact personally if they want to or else the application provided a platform to post a query and students could answer the queries. All the queries and replies could be viewed.
